## Problem Description
<!-- A short description of the problem you are solving. Why is the brain graph super-resolution an ineresting problem to solve? -->
This repository focuses on the problem of Brain Graph Super-Resolution. Graph super-resolution is the process of generating a graph with \(N'\) nodes from a graph with $N$ nodes, where \(N' > N\). The goal is to develop a model capable of inferring a higher-resolution graph from a lower-resolution graph, with additional nodes (and edges), while preserving the structure and functional properties of the original graph.

Brain Graph Super-Resolution poses both immense potential as well as significant challenges.
The code in this repository demonstrates how we can effectively generate higher resolution brain graphs which could lead to improved diagnostics and treatment. The key challenge still lies with evaluating such super-resolved graphs in the absence of a ground truth.
